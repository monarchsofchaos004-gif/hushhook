# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - Unreleased

- New secret rule for Shopify Admin API access tokens (`shpat_`, `shpca_`, `shppa_`, `shpss_`); short or non-hex lookalikes stay unmasked.
- `hushhook explain <rule-id>`: shows where a rule lives, how to turn it off, and a ready link to report a wrong match (only the rule id goes in the link).
- When a read or command is blocked, the message now tells the agent that the user can run `hushhook explain <rule-id>`.
- `hushhook rules new <kind> <id>`: creates a starter file for a rule of your own and makes sure your config loads it.
- `hushhook rules share <id>`: checks your examples and, if they pass and hold no real-looking secret, prints a link so others using the service get the rule too.
- New secret rules for Notion integration tokens (`ntn_`) and legacy integration tokens (`secret_`); ordinary identifiers such as `secret_key_base` stay unmasked.
- New file rules for Pulumi (`.pulumi/credentials.json`) and Sentry (`.sentryclirc`) credential files.

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased
